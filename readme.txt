Devoloped by: Noah Burton and Amir Jacobs

Narrative: 2011 is when the first dragon was spotted in Japan emerging from Mount Fuji, this was the emergence of magic in the world. In the same year children were born different, stout and study or with long ears and slender bodies, this was the begining of the new age, the age of magic one of elves and dwarfs. After 10 years of trying to get seattled in the world another hurdle was thrown at the fractured world, goblinization, a proccess of humans turning into Orcs and Trolls a painful proccess that struck many even those who were human before. Goblinization left the world wondering if another strange genetic mutation would arrise leaving the world on edge of what will happen next. As the world went on Corporations gained extraterritoriality, a decision made when a nuclear waste truck was attacked being mistaken for a food truck in New York City during a time of hunger with the corporation responsible having to take extreme measures to make sure the mob did not expose the city to the waste. The world was thrown into chaos, the United States was thrown into Chaos as the nation fractured, now known as the United Canadian American States the country only occupies the North Eastern half of the country, with one execption, Seattle. This is where you hail from and the city is divided as ever, Corporations lord over the city. The current Governer Brackhaven is a CEO of a banking corporation that is taking money from more then one shady deal. One of these deals is too stop the the Seattle Underground from being recognized as having district status, which would be a win for the underclass workers that work as cheap and expendable labor for the mighty corporations that dominate Seattle. You are here to hack into Brackhavens office and steal incriminating data and allowing the propostion to pass which would otherwise be shut down by the governer. You are a decker, using your knowledge and tools to jump into the Matrix, a successor to the internet of the past, a world in which data takes forms easier for those in VR or AR to interact with. Buildings that protect files, locks in place of firewalls, whatever the user wants can take form. 

Instructions: You will be navigating matrix with an important tool "ls" and "cd" These commands are important tools that allow you to enter other areas (cd allows you to change directories in linux) and see whats around you (ls allows you too see whats in your directory in linux) You will want to explore around and use "cat" to read the areas description for hints on what to do. Good luck Chummer! 
For example:
$ls
$cd TheEntrance
