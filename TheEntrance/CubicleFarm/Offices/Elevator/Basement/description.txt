The elevator doors open and the horrors here are unthinkable.
This is what Brackhaven must not want to get out, this will make him resign for sure.

The scene before you is one all too common on the streets of seattle, cypto and nft addicts fighting for their treasures.
The mass of people is behind a study, well built fence and you see the people hoarding and selling what they have relentlessly.
The ring of phones as they try to sell high and buy low make the room buzz with the thrum of sale pitches and ruined investments.
Cheers erupt as some win big then are promply drownd out by the cries of those who lost it all.
"27.6 boge coin for my child" you hear a women scream out.
"Ape with a cape for food" a gangly man whispers on the floor.
"Skwid coin for 20 quid" a sharply dressed british man yells.
Predators and prey, a shocking site.
Brackhaven is running an illegal NFT and crypto selling ring. This is evidence for you but for the public there must be documentation.
You push the button for excutive offices to find the dirt you are looking for, to help these poor souls.
