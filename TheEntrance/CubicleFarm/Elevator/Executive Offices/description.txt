You've made it to the final area.  The immaculate surroundings are indeed worthy of the Executive title.
The stark white and clostraphobic interiors of the farm of Cubicles gives way to a open and warm suite.
This place seems much more akin to a lounge than anything resembling offices.
They even have water coolers up here!
This comes as no surprise though.  Brackhaven and his company had to invest their ill gotten gains somewhere.  Of course they'd invest in those at the top.

Taking another cursory glance about the area, it seems to be much more bare than the other areas in terms of devices.
Makes just about sense though.  Of course those at the top don't do work.  They just push it all onto the lower tier workers.
You don't see much that stands out, but there is a keypad on a wall at the far end of the room.
You're surprised an upper echelon member of the company would be so careless as to leave this open, but their arrogance has most likely gone to their heads.

Utilize this to the best of your abilities!
