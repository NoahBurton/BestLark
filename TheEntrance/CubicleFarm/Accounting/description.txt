A single chained lightbulb hangs from the ceiling flickering as most of the light here is produced from massive computing towers flickering icons. 
Sandwhiched between the twin towers is a small pepper and salt haired man nervously tapping a pencil on the small desk provided in front of him as he stares at his moniter.
Numbers go by faster then you can see on the moniter as it seems to be the accounting for the company.
The small man mutters to himself as his chewed on pencil scribbles hastly onto a large notepad with many torn off pages.
You catch a few unsavory words as he works.
"Can't believe I ended up here"
"Fall guy for the transfers"
"All this for some lousy NFTs"
"Been here 40 years and this is what I get"

As his pencil stops his chair swivles to you with his eyes laying upon you.
His image matches, this is the mole you have been searching for.

"You must be the guy, about time" He mutters as his leg bounces up and down.
