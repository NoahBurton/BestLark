As far as the eye can see spands bleek eggshell white that reeks of corportation. The room here is a massive cube with a drab cream color to add to the opressive at atmosphere.
Each cubical has a user within it each seemingly dull eyes that type away endlessly at their computers.
As you enter some eyes land on you, some just going straight back to work but some lingering, your cyberdeck should show you as an allowed user but if GOD finds out you are here there may be some trouble ahead.
As you walk seemingly endless rows of cubicals looking around for your prize, some insider info has landed you a few users who would be willing to talk.
You spot a few users that you believe to be your moles however with the security here you are not sure who is who so be careful about who you contact.
