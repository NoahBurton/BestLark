You plug the cold steel bundled wire into your data jack and feel the surge of binary rush into your mind, the numbers turning into information as your modifications do their work. 
The sensation is overwhelming at first but now a comfort as the digital world starts to build itself around you, a cold hard plastisteel building rises into site. 
The sleek grey building sports an open door for normal cliental but you arenâ€™t interested in that. 
You start up your cyberdeck, the ole Novatech Navigator and start marking the important entrances and start making your moves all while avoiding GOD, the Grid Overwatch Division, the all-seeing corporation AI made to stop those of your like. 
Moving around you spot a slip in security and pry it open, taking the form of a door with a keypad you enter the code and slide into the building unnoticed. 
You enter into a large waiting room, plain white chairs line the walls as the receptionist desk looks abandoned. 
Two doors lead out besides the one you came in from. 
One door labeled Sector One and another labeled Cubicle Farm. 
Grim, even for the largest corporations.

Here you see your first challenge the program you used to get into here cannot be used to open Sector One is by using the same command cd but by modifying it. 
Instead of cd Sector One you need to type the first word Sector with a \ in front of it then the second word with a / after it.
Example: cd Example\ here/
