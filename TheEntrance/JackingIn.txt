You plug the cold steel bundled wire into your data jack and feel the surge of binary rush into your mind, the numbers turning into information as your modifications do their work. 
The sensation is overwhelming at first but now a comfort as the digital world starts to build itself around you, a cold hard plastisteel building rises into site. 
The sleek grey building sports an open door for normal cliental but you arenâ€™t interested in that. 
You start up your cyberdeck, the Novatech Navigator and start marking the important entrances and start making your moves all while avoiding GOD, the Grid Overwatch Division, the all-seeing corporation AI made to stop those of your like. 
Moving around you spot a slip in security and pry it open, taking the form of a door with a keypad you enter the code and slide into the building unnoticed.






















The world comes into view around you.

You do have eyeballs of course.

To utliize them and check your surrounding, be sure to use the ls input.

Your feet do exist as well just so you know.

To move between locations make sure you're using the cd input.

For example:
$ls
$cd room1 

Now, be sure to utlize your eyes and feet to the best of their ability in the subsequent rooms you come across.
