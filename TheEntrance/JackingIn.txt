Test

The world comes into view around you.

You do have eyeballs of course.

To utliize them and check your surrounding, be sure to use the ls input.

Your feet do exist as well just so you know.

To move between locations make sure you're using the cd input.

For example:
$ls
$cd room1 

Now, be sure to utlize your eyes and feet to the best of their ability in the subsequent rooms you come across.
