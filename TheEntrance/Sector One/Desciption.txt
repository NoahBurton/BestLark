This room starts as a small hallway and opens into a spacious room with large rectangle obsidian file cabinets stretch as far as the eye can see with what appears to be no end. Each obsidian cabinet stamped with the mark of Brackhavenâ€™s banking. The sounds of files cabinets closing and opening assault your ears as the cacophony of sounds ring out muffled from the maze of file cabinets. As you get accustomed to the harsh noises you notice each padlocks on each filing cabinet, a few you see however can be coerced to be opened with a loving touch of your Novatech Navigator and the quick hands and thinking that have already gotten you out of many bad situations. Laying the thought to rest for now you continue onward weaving through the labyrinthian maze stepping slow and trying to avoid patrolling the ever-watching eye of GOD. Slowly but surely, you wind through and find another exit, large doors with opaque windows leading to the unknown. You can explore and try to crack these padlocks. 

Using the ls -a command you can find hidden files, directories, scripts and etc. Maybe here you could find a hidden cabinet in the maze that is unlocked.
