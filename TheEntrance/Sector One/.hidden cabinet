After using your new tool you quickly scan the room and find a unlocked cabinet tucked and hidden away.
This dusty cabinet seems to hold a program that allows you to access programs written in the Brackhaven system.
You load the program onto your cyberdeck and you are ready to go!

(To run programs in linux you put ./ProgramName and it will run the program maybe try it on some cabinet here to see what they do!)

These cabinets will be present here and in the outside world, these are called hidden files these files begin with a "." to be hidden from users.
Using your new utility command you were able to find the the hidden file!
